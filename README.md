# Simple_processor

## ISA: MIPS

This repository contains the final project based on the course "Computer Organization" at NYCU.

### Overview

- **SP.v:** The Verilog code for a Simple Processor design, supporting a 5-stage pipeline, and tailored for the MIPS instruction set.
- 
- **MEM.v:** Responsible for controlling the access of input data.
- 
- **PATTERN.v:** Manages all data entering the processor, including instruction (inst) and instruction address (inst_addr).
- 
- **TESTBED.v:** The top-level testbench, responsible for reading test data from a text file and providing it to the Simple Processor for simulation.

This repository contains Verilog code, testbench, test pattern, spec.png, which visually describes the project's specifications or circuit diagram.
